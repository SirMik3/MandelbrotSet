## Introduction

The **Mandelbrot Set** is a mathematical fractal named after Beno√Æt Mandelbrot. This project visualizes the Mandelbrot set in real-time using modern OpenGL shaders, allowing users to interactively explore the fractal's infinite complexity. By leveraging GPU computing power, this implementation renders high-resolution views of the fractal, with adjustable color schemes and zoom capabilities for deep exploration of the set's intricate details.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure that you have the following installed on your machine:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- OpenGL-compatible graphics card with GLSL shader support

You can install the required Python libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy PyOpenGL glfw
